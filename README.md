Each mechanic is rooted in tapping on the screen. Interacting with cards or shop and general menu buttons requires you to tap on each card, and movement around the casino requires simply tapping to navigate your character throughout the space. 

## How To Play
Your ultimate goal is to earn enough chips to pay back the owner and progress through the casino and the different games it has to offer. Approach the various casino tables on the floor to play different games, including Matching, Blackjack, Poker, and Slots. Play this games in your own fashion by stopping by the shop to purchase outfits with your winnings, as well as using them to make general progress through the game. Your various customization options will remain consistent throughout the different "levels".

Story Mode:
Enter story mode by choosing "Story" from the main menu. In story mode, you'll have to unlock each of the games individually by earning enough chips to pay back the house.
Start by bartending to buy your first game: matching. From there earn more chips to buy blackjack, poker, and slots. After unlocking all of the games, you gain access to
Freeplay where you can openly play any of the games. You can also spend your money in the shop to buy cosmetics. Be sure to speak to the owner after you unlock each game
for unique dialogue.

For testing purposes Freeplay will be unlocked by default.
